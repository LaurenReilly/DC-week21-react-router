            <p className="text-center">Said the grinning boy, his dark eyes narrowing to slits in his pale face as he circled the diary menacingly.</p>
            <p className="text-center">Harry thought for a moment. If he guessed Tom Riddle's riddle wrong he would surely be trapped in this chamber forever with nothing but a blinded Basilisk for company. He must have been taking too long to answer because Riddle hissed impatiently at him, "No man has ever been able to answer correctly!"</p>
            <p className="text-center">"I am no man!" said Harry the famous boy wizard. Thats when he saw them, small buzzing white lights circling Tom Riddle's pocketses. Confidently Harry shouted, "You've got Wrackspurts in your pocket don't you Tom?"</p>
