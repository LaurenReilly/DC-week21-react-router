        <p className="text-center">Let alone anyone to share it with. Now, here he sat in a small compartment on the Fangorn Express surrounded by a group of chattering witches and wizards! They weren't scowling at him with disdain, nor treating him as if he was less than the rankest Orc like the Sackville-Baggins used to back at home.</p>
        <p className="text-center">"This is a precious moment" Frodo thought as he chose what he hoped was a lembas flavored jelly bean from the pile in front of him. Smiling he popped it into his mouth. "Alas, Entwash!" Frodo exclaimed a second later, while coughing up the tricksy bean.</p>
